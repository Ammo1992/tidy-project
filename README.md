## The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## About the project- The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz are captured and recorded. This data is used for recognition of Human activity.

## Tools used for the project
     R Studio
     
## Steps to produce and reproduce this project

1. see the code book.md and open run_analysis.R

2. run the code in full or line by line. the code is explained via comments in the .R file itself

3.the final data is written out to tidyData.txt file name the set directory

4. the codebook is in CodeBook.md
